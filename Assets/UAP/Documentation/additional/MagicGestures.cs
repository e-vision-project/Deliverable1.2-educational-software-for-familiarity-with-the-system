 * <h1>What is a Magic Gesture?</h1>
 * 
 * Swipes and double taps are not the only way that blind users navigate an app. There are a few special gestures 
 * that will trigger certain actions, such as "Back" or "Pause", or "Read the screen from the Top".<br>
 * If you are interested in reading more, here is a reference of gestures and keyboard commands that are supported by Apple's VoiceOver screen reader: <a href="http://axslab.com/articles/ios-voiceover-gestures-and-keyboard-commands.php"><b>VoiceOver Gestures</b></a>
 * 
 * These gestures are invaluable to a visually impaired user, as they cannot find the back or pause button 
 * the same way a seeing user can, or the soft back button that Android has on the bottom of the screen. <br> 
 * Your app or game can react to these gestures by registering for OnPause or OnBack callback events.
 * 
 * <em>Magic Gestures will be detected even when the Accessibility Manager is paused, but not when it is disabled.</em><br>
 * This allows the game to suspend the accessibility if the main gameplay requires it, but still allow blind players
 * to pause the game.
 * 
 * DEBUGGING: In Editor, holding the ALT key down while tapping the left mouse button will emulate a second finger. This allows debugging and testing of gestures requiring more than one finger during mobile development. By default, only mouse taps/clicks are registered. If developing for mobile, you can turn on "Mouse Swiping" in the Settings to enable swipe simulation with the mouse as well.
